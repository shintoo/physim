A parametric force application simulator

#synopsis
	usage: phsyim <file>

#description
This program recieves input from a file that specifies the mass of an object, a time interval, the window for the graph, abd forces applied on the object. see example for formatting.
It uses the forces, their application times, and the mass of the object to graph the position of the object. Currently, starting position and velocity are both <0,0>, but it is planned to add initial position and velocity options to the input file.
This program outputs the graph to a file.
